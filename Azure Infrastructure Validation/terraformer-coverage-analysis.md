## 2. Resources Imported by Terraformer

```md
## Resources Successfully Imported by Terraformer

The following Azure resource types were successfully mapped and generated
as Terraform code using Terraformer.
```

## 3. Resources Not Exported by Terraformer (Tool Limitation)

```md
## Azure Resources Not Exported by Terraformer

The following resources exist in Azure but were not generated by Terraformer.
These require alternate approaches (manual Terraform, ARM/Bicep, or API-based tooling).
```

### Not Exported Due to Terraformer Coverage Gaps

```text
Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults
Microsoft.Insights/components
Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces
Microsoft.Insights/dataCollectionRules
microsoft.insights/actiongroups
microsoft.alertsmanagement/smartDetectorAlertRules
Microsoft.Logic/workflows
Microsoft.Web/staticSites
Microsoft.Web/connections
Microsoft.DevCenter/devcenters
microsoft.visualstudio/account
```

> Note: Some of these resources are supported by Terraform providers,
> but Terraformer does not currently export them.

## 4. SQL Resources – Known Terraformer Issue

```md
## SQL Resources – Terraformer Limitation

Terraformer attempted to import SQL resources but failed due to a known provider issue.
```

### Affected Resources

```text
Microsoft.Sql/servers
Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases
```

### Reason

```text
Terraformer crashes on:
azurerm_sql_active_directory_administrator
```

As a result, SQL Server and Database resources were excluded from the final Terraformer output.

---

## 5. Key Takeaway (Very Important)

```md
## Summary

- Terraformer provides **partial infrastructure coverage**.
- Missing resources are **not missing in Azure**, only missing from Terraformer output.
- Terraformer is suitable for **baseline infrastructure extraction**, not full fidelity.
- Additional tools (manual Terraform, ARM/Bicep, Scout Suite, APIs) are required for completeness.
```
